## My First Project
My first `startup` is building enterprise management system for Schools. During the initial phase of the project, the most challenging part is in choosing the right framework and tools for the project. We started by choosing Java EE platform which finally we end up trying primeface for our first demo project. But I'm not satisfied with it. I am not fully like the way my app is structured and also did not like the platform. I keep on searching for the right framework within the java programming language and end up using Vaadin Framework for the project.
```bash
gatsby develop

```
